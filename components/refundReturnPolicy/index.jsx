              Once a customer receives the shipment with any defect, damage, or objection, please carefully inspect our packaging products and instantly inform us with photographs of the ‘subject objections’ within 3 business days.

            </li>
            <li className="refund_policy_para">
            If you receive an order with missing items, call and email us instantly, along with a packing list of the products.

             Our official turnaround time is <span className="change_color">12 to 15</span> business days, but it can rarely be extended to a few days more due to some high-end color matching, time-consuming screen printing, delicate foil printing, etc. 

            </li>
            <li className="refund_policy_para change_color">
            It is our practice to ship extra packaging products than the actual ordered quantities to all our clients, but please be notified that there is always a 5% to 10% increase or decrease margin in the packaging items, i.e., boxes, Mylar bags, labels, stickers, business cards, and any other printed products. So, if rarely, you receive a few items less than the ordered quantities then no packaging products, returns, or refunds will be approved by us.

            </li>
            <li className="refund_policy_para">
            If you find a notable difference in the dimensions of our packaging products above the usable level, then return them.

             If you make any packaging product from scratch with us, then no return or refund will be accepted, as while availing of full customization, you partner with us for every packaging procedure. So, we don't process any replacement or reimbursement for such orders.

            <li className="refund_policy_para">
              Returns and refunds become acceptable if we (Print 247) have printed and produced packaging products that are dissimilar to the final approved digital proof, computer-generated 3D mockup or physical prototype of the ‘ordered packaging product.’

              Any type of food grade, cosmetics, chemical-related, hazardous, or pharmaceutical regulatory-compliant packaging or labeling is the client's responsibility. For instance, you will inform us beforehand of your packaging requirements according to FDA, FTC, USDA, GHS, USDA, or any other industry-specific packaging and labeling requirements, as we only print and produce what you acquire from us.

            </li>
            <li className="refund_policy_para">
              In case of any discrepancies, please don’t use, open, modify, alter, or temper any of the packaging products.

            </li>
            <li className="refund_policy_para">
              If packaging products are improperly handled, stored, or used, they will be considered unfit for return.

            <li className="refund_policy_para">
            We will not be able to return packaging products due to slight variations in dimensions or colors caused by digital or monitors’ calibration [screen colors gamuts, brightness, viewing angles due to basic difference between RGB colors of digital screens and machine colors, i.e., CMYK, Screen colors, glittering foil colors, and physical appearance of the packaging products] (to refrain from this issue, we highly recommend getting a physical prototype by us of your products before going to final production).
