        <h2>Visual Identity and Packaging <br /> Design for Alcoken</h2>
        <p>Visual identity and packaging for Alcoken. Started from the perspective of children, and with the childishness and innocence of a child, AICOKEN connects the distance between children and clothing by the fabric temperature. Inspired by {'"stay curious"'} and is based on the shape of a small bench, The brand design of AICOKEN symbolizes children standing on their tiptoes, growing and exploring with full of curiosity. We chose the A of AICOKEN as the prototype to create a cartoon image with a vibrant A silhouette. It looks friendly, bold, brave and energetic. We used it throughout the brand packaging, hoping to accompany children to experience the beauty of life together.</p>
